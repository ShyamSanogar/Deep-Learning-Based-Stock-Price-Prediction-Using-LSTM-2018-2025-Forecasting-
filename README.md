# Deep-Learning-Based-Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM-2018-2025-Forecasting-
This project builds a deep learning model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks) to predict stock prices based on historical market data and technical indicators. It includes an end-to-end pipeline for data collection, feature engineering, model training, backtesting, and multi-step future forecasting up to 2025.
